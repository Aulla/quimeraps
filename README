Quimera printing service is a jon-rpc server that processes jasperreports reports and fills them with the information received through calls to the service.

It consists of 3 parts:
-server. Json-rpc server processing calls
-customer. PyQt6 interface in charge of viewing the status of the server and managing printers and models.
-daemon. Allows you to install and / or remove the quimera service on the host operating system.
